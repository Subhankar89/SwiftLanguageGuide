// Arrays are ordered collections of values.
// Sets are unordered collections of unique values.
// Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

//MARK:- Array

//Bridging Between Array and NSArray

//When you need to access APIs that require data in an NSArray instance instead of Array, use the type-cast operator (as) to bridge your instance.

//For bridging to be possible, the Element type of your array must be a class, an @objc protocol (a protocol imported from Objective-C or marked with the @objc attribute), or a type that bridges to a Foundation type.

let colors = ["periwinkle", "rose", "moss"]
let moreColors: [String?] = ["ochre", "pine"]

let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: "names.plist")
(colors as NSArray).write(to: url, atomically: true)
//true

(moreColors as NSArray).write(to: url, atomically: true)
// error: cannot convert value of type '[String?]' to type 'NSArray'


//Creating an Array with a Default Value

var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: 3)
//[0.0,0.0,0.0]

//Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together

var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)

var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles

//Creating an Array with an Array Literal

var shoppingList = ["Eggs", "Milk"]

//Accessing and Modifying an Array

print("The shopping list contains \(shoppingList.count) items.")

if shoppingList.isEmpty {
    print("The shopping list is empty.")
} else {
    print("The shopping list isn't empty.")
}

shoppingList.append("Flour")

shoppingList += ["Baking Powder"]

shoppingList += ["Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", "Butter"]

//Retrieve a value from the array by using subscript syntax, passing the index of the value you want to retrieve within square brackets immediately after the name of the array:

var firstItem = shoppingList[0]

shoppingList[0] = "Six eggs" // subscript syntax to change an existing value

shoppingList[4...6] = ["Bananas", "Apples"] //replaces "Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", and "Butter" with "Bananas" and "Apples"

shoppingList.insert("Maple Syrup", at: 0)

let mapleSyrup = shoppingList.remove(at: 0) // the mapleSyrup constant is now equal to the removed "Maple Syrup" string

//Iterating Over and Array

for item in shoppingList {
    print(item)
}

for (index,value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {
    print("Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
}


//MARK:- Sets

// A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering.

//Bridging works same as in Array

//Hash Values for Set Types

//A type must be hashable in order to be stored in a set‚Äîthat is, the type must provide a way to compute a hash value for itself.

//A hash value is an Int value that‚Äôs the same for all objects that compare equally, such that if a == b, the hash value of a is equal to the hash value of b.

//Enumeration case values without associated values are also hashable by default

var letters = Set<Character>()

print("letters is of type Set<Character> with \(letters.count) items.")
// Prints "letters is of type Set<Character> with 0 items."

letters.insert("a")

//Creating a Set with Array Literal

var favoriteGenres: Set<String> = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]

//Accesssing and Modifying a Set

print("I have \(favoriteGenres.count) favorite music genres.")
// Prints "I have 3 favorite music genres."

if favoriteGenres.isEmpty {
    print("As far as music goes, I'm not picky.")
} else {
    print("I have particular music preferences.")
}
// Prints "I have particular music preferences."

favoriteGenres.insert("Jazz")
// favoriteGenres now contains 4 items

if let removedGenre = favoriteGenres.remove("Rock") {
    print("\(removedGenre)? I'm over it.")
} else {
    print("I never much cared for that.")
}
// Prints "Rock? I'm over it."

if favoriteGenres.contains("Funk") {
    print("I get up on the good foot.")
} else {
    print("It's too funky in here.")
}
// Prints "It's too funky in here."


//Iterating Over a Set

for genre in favoriteGenres {
    print("\(genre)")
}

for genre in favoriteGenres.sorted() {
    print(("\(genre)"))
}

//Performing Set Operations

//Use the intersection(_:) method to create a new set with only the values common to both sets.
//Use the symmetricDifference(_:) method to create a new set with values in either set, but not both.
//Use the union(_:) method to create a new set with all of the values in both sets.
//Use the subtracting(_:) method to create a new set with values not in the specified set.

let oddDigits: Set = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
let evenDigits: Set = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
let singleDigitPrimeNumbers: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]

oddDigits.union(evenDigits).sorted()
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
oddDigits.intersection(evenDigits).sorted()
// []
oddDigits.subtracting(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 9]
oddDigits.symmetricDifference(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 2, 9]

//Set Membership and Equality

//MARK:- Dictionaries

//Bridging between Dictionary and NSDictionary

var namesOfIntegers = [Int: String]()

namesOfIntegers[16] = "sixteen"
// namesOfIntegers now contains 1 key-value pair
namesOfIntegers = [:]
// namesOfIntegers is once again an empty dictionary of type [Int: String]

//Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal

var airports: [String: String] = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]

//Accessing and Modifying a Dictionary

print("The airports dictionary contains \(airports.count) items.")
// Prints "The airports dictionary contains 2 items."

if airports.isEmpty {
    print("The airports dictionary is empty.")
} else {
    print("The airports dictionary isn't empty.")
}
// Prints "The airports dictionary isn't empty."

airports["LHR"] = "London"
// the airports dictionary now contains 3 items

airports["LHR"] = "London Heathrow"
// the value for "LHR" has been changed to "London Heathrow"

if let oldValue = airports.updateValue("Dublin Airport", forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The old value for DUB was \(oldValue).")

// Prints "The old value for DUB was Dublin."

if let airportName = airports["DUB"] {
    print("The name of the airport is \(airportName).")
} else {
    print("That airport isn't in the airports dictionary.")
}
// Prints "The name of the airport is Dublin Airport."

airports["APL"] = "Apple International"
// "Apple International" isn't the real airport for APL, so delete it
airports["APL"] = nil
// APL has now been removed from the dictionary

if let removedValue = airports.removeValue(forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The removed airport's name is \(removedValue).")
} else {
    print("The airports dictionary doesn't contain a value for DUB.")
}
// Prints "The removed airport's name is Dublin Airport."

//Iterating Over a Dictionary

for (airportCode, airportName) in airports {
    print("\(airportCode): \(airportName)")
}

for airportCode in airports.keys {
    print("Airport code: \(airportCode)")
}
// Airport code: LHR
// Airport code: YYZ

for airportName in airports.values {
    print("Airport name: \(airportName)")
}
// Airport name: London Heathrow
// Airport name: Toronto Pearson

//If you need to use a dictionary‚Äôs keys or values with an API that takes an Array instance, initialize a new array with the keys or values property:

let airportCodes = [String](airports.keys)
// airportCodes is ["LHR", "YYZ"]

let airportNames = [String](airports.values)
// airportNames is ["London Heathrow", "Toronto Pearson"]
