//You can‚Äôt append a String or Character to an existing Character variable, because a Character value must contain a single character only.

//MARK:- Working with Characters

//you can create a stand-alone Character constant or variable from a single-character string literal by providing a Character type annotation:

let exclamationMark: Character = "!" //always a single character

let catCharacters: [Character] = ["C", "a", "t", "!", "üê±"]
let catString = String(catCharacters)
print(catString)

//MARK:- String Interpolation

//NOTE: The expressions you write inside parentheses within an interpolated string can‚Äôt contain an unescaped backslash (\), a carriage return, or a line feed. However, they can contain other string literals.

//MARK:- Unicode

//Unicode is an international standard for encoding, representing, and processing text in different writing systems.

//Unicode Scalar Values

//Behind the scenes, Swift‚Äôs native String type is built from Unicode scalar values. A Unicode scalar value is a unique 21-bit number for a character or modifier, such as U+0061 for LATIN SMALL LETTER A ("a"), or U+1F425 for FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK ("üê•").

//Extended Grapheme Cluster

//An extended grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode scalars that (when combined) produce a single human-readable character. Extended grapheme clusters are a flexible way to represent many complex script characters as a single Character value

let eAcute: Character = "\u{E9}"                         // √© , its a single scalar
let combinedEAcute: Character = "\u{65}\u{301}"          // e followed by, cluster of two scalars
// eAcute is √©, combinedEAcute is eÃÅ

//MARK:- Counting Characters

//To retrieve a count of the Character values in a string, use the count property of the string

let unusualMenagerie = "Koala üê®, Snail üêå, Penguin üêß, Dromedary üê™"
print("unusualMenagerie has \(unusualMenagerie.count) characters")

var word = "cafe"
print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in cafe is 4"

word += "\u{301}"    // COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT, U+0301

print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in cafeÃÅ is 4"

//MARK:-Very Imp Note:

//  Extended grapheme clusters can be composed of multiple Unicode scalars. This means that different characters‚Äîand different representations of the same character‚Äîcan require different amounts of memory to store. Because of this, characters in Swift don‚Äôt each take up the same amount of memory within a string‚Äôs representation. As a result, the number of characters in a string can‚Äôt be calculated without iterating through the string to determine its extended grapheme cluster boundaries. If you are working with particularly long string values, be aware that the count property must iterate over the Unicode scalars in the entire string in order to determine the characters for that string.The count of the characters returned by the count property isn‚Äôt always the same as the length property of an NSString that contains the same characters. The length of an NSString is based on the number of 16-bit code units within the string‚Äôs UTF-16 representation and not the number of Unicode extended grapheme clusters within the string.

//MARK:- Accessing and Modifying a String

//String Indices

//different characters can require different amounts of memory to store, so in order to determine which Character is at a particular position, you must iterate over each Unicode scalar from the start or end of that String. For this reason, Swift strings can‚Äôt be indexed by integer values.

let greeting = "Guten Tag!"
greeting[greeting.startIndex]
// G
greeting[greeting.index(before: greeting.endIndex)]
// !
greeting[greeting.index(after: greeting.startIndex)]
// u
let index = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 7)
greeting[index]
// a

//Use the indices property to access all of the indices of individual characters in a string.

for index in greeting.indices {
    print("\(greeting[index])", terminator: "")
}

//Inserting and Removing

// To insert a single character into a string at a specified index, use the insert(_:at:) method, and to insert the contents of another string at a specified index, use the insert(contentsOf:at:) method.

var welcome = "hello"
welcome.insert("!", at: welcome.endIndex)

welcome.insert(contentsOf: " there", at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))

//welcome now equals "hello there!"

//To remove a single character from a string at a specified index, use the remove(at:) method, and to remove a substring at a specified range, use the removeSubrange(_:) method:

welcome.remove(at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))


let range = welcome.index(welcome.endIndex, offsetBy: -6)..<welcome.endIndex
welcome.removeSubrange(range)

print(welcome)


//MARK:- Substrings

//When you get a substring from a string‚Äîfor example, using a subscript or a method like prefix(_:)‚Äîthe result is an instance of Substring, not another string. Substrings in Swift have most of the same methods as strings, which means you can work with substrings the same way you work with strings. However, unlike strings, you use substrings for only a short amount of time while performing actions on a string. When you‚Äôre ready to store the result for a longer time, you convert the substring to an instance of String.

let ind = greeting.firstIndex(of: ",") ?? greeting.endIndex
let beginning = greeting[..<ind]
//beginning is "Hello"

//Convert the result to a String for long term storage
let newString = String(beginning)

//The difference between strings and substrings is that, as a performance optimization, a substring can reuse part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store the original string, or part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store another substring. (Strings have a similar optimization, but if two strings share memory, they‚Äôre equal.) This performance optimization means you don‚Äôt have to pay the performance cost of copying memory until you modify either the string or substring. As mentioned above, substrings aren‚Äôt suitable for long-term storage‚Äîbecause they reuse the storage of the original string, the entire original string must be kept in memory as long as any of its substrings are being used.

//MARK:- Comparing Strings

//Swift provides three ways to compare textual values: string and character equality, prefix equality, and suffix equality.

//String and Character Equality

//Two String values (or two Character values) are considered equal if their extended grapheme clusters are canonically equivalent. Extended grapheme clusters are canonically equivalent if they have the same linguistic meaning and appearance, even if they‚Äôre composed from different Unicode scalars behind the scenes.

// "Voulez-vous un caf√©?" using LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE
let eAcuteQuestion = "Voulez-vous un caf\u{E9}?"

// "Voulez-vous un cafeÃÅ?" using LATIN SMALL LETTER E and COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT
let combinedEAcuteQuestion = "Voulez-vous un caf\u{65}\u{301}?"

if eAcuteQuestion == combinedEAcuteQuestion {
    print("These two strings are considered equal")
}
// Prints "These two strings are considered equal"

//Conversely, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041, or "A"), as used in English, is not equivalent to CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0410, or "–ê"), as used in Russian. The characters are visually similar, but don‚Äôt have the same linguistic meaning:

let latinCapitalLetterA: Character = "\u{41}"

let cyrillicCapitalLetterA: Character = "\u{0410}"

if latinCapitalLetterA != cyrillicCapitalLetterA {
    print("These two characters aren't equivalent.")
}
// Prints "These two characters aren't equivalent."

//Prefix and Suffix Equality

// To check whether a string has a particular string prefix or suffix, call the string‚Äôs hasPrefix(_:) and hasSuffix(_:) methods, both of which take a single argument of type String and return a Boolean value.

let romeoAndJuliet = [
    "Act 1 Scene 1: Verona, A public place",
    "Act 1 Scene 2: Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 1 Scene 3: A room in Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 1 Scene 4: A street outside Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 1 Scene 5: The Great Hall in Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 2 Scene 1: Outside Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 2 Scene 2: Capulet's orchard",
    "Act 2 Scene 3: Outside Friar Lawrence's cell",
    "Act 2 Scene 4: A street in Verona",
    "Act 2 Scene 5: Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 2 Scene 6: Friar Lawrence's cell"
]

var act1SceneCount = 0

for scene in romeoAndJuliet {
    if scene.hasPrefix("Act1") {
        act1SceneCount += 1
    }
}

print("There are \(act1SceneCount) scenes in Act 1")

var mansionCount = 0
var cellCount = 0

for scene in romeoAndJuliet {
    if scene.hasSuffix("Capulet's mansion") {
        mansionCount += 1
    } else if scene.hasSuffix("Friar Lawrence's cell") {
        cellCount += 1
    }
}

print("\(mansionCount) mansion scenes; \(cellCount) cell scenes")

//MARK:- Unicode Representations of Strings

//When a Unicode string is written to a text file or some other storage, the Unicode scalars in that string are encoded in one of several Unicode-defined encoding forms. Each form encodes the string in small chunks known as code units. These include the UTF-8 encoding form (which encodes a string as 8-bit code units), the UTF-16 encoding form (which encodes a string as 16-bit code units), and the UTF-32 encoding form (which encodes a string as 32-bit code units).

// Alternatively, access a String value in one of three other Unicode-compliant representations:

//A collection of UTF-8 code units (accessed with the string‚Äôs utf8 property)
//A collection of UTF-16 code units (accessed with the string‚Äôs utf16 property)
//A collection of 21-bit Unicode scalar values, equivalent to the string‚Äôs UTF-32 encoding form (accessed with the string‚Äôs unicodeScalars property)


//UTF-8 representation
let mufString = "Dog‚Äºüê∂"

for codeUnit in mufString.utf8 {
    print("\(codeUnit) ", terminator: "")
}
print("")
// Prints "68 111 103 226 128 188 240 159 144 182 "

//UTF-16 Representation

for codeUnit in mufString.utf16 {
    print("\(codeUnit) ", terminator: "")
}
print("")
// Prints "68 111 103 8252 55357 56374 "

//Unicode Scalar Representation

for scalar in mufString.unicodeScalars {
    print("\(scalar.value) ", terminator: "")
}
print("")
// Prints "68 111 103 8252 128054 "

//As an alternative to querying their value properties, each UnicodeScalar value can also be used to construct a new String value, such as with string interpolation:

for scalar in mufString.unicodeScalars {
    print("\(scalar) ")
}

// D
// o
// g
// ‚Äº
// üê∂
